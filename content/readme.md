# Model Credit

I made the following models in Maya 2015:

* cube.fbx
* dodecahedron.fbx
* helix.fbx
* icosahedron.fbx
* smooth_cube.fbx
* soccer_ball.fbx
* tetrahedron.fbx

All other models were converted from [their original OBJ format](https://github.com/erik/obj-viewer/tree/master/models)
into their current FBX format using Maya 2015.
